# Project "Outils Biblio"

This project, in the context of a dual internship between Bio-Informatics Master and Computer Science licence, for the [AFMB (Architecture and Function of Biological Macromolecules )](http://www.afmb.univ-mrs.fr/?lang=en) and the [CEA of Cadarache](http://www.afmb.univ-mrs.fr/?lang=en), have a goal to produce a funtionning website to simplify the scientific oversight in theses laboratories.

# Context (Problematic)
Scientific oversight can be a long and tremdemous task. Usually few people have this task, to find the article, see their interest and if it's an article of interest, to store it, annotate it, sometime send it to a team member by email, etc. The biggest issue here is that nothing is centralised. We may have some databses such as PubMEd/MedLine, but even here they don't have access to an easy sharing system and an annotation system. Thus, this project's goal aim to solve theses issue, by giving a modern, easy-to-use website for scientific oversight.
